## Hello Folks! Welcome to my data science projects repository!


### About Me

A young and inquisitive electrical engineering graduate who is passionate about artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications. **Completed Data Science with Python and R course** by 360DigiTMG and Center of Applied Data Science (CADS) **certified Advanced Enterprise Data Analyst Program**. Approximately 1-year of working experience in **program management area** in structured and unstructured data projects. 

Currently, I am focusing on building my data science portfolio through machine learning model development for my data science projects. I am applying exploratory descriptive analysis (EDA) approach for data preparation and supervised and unsupervised algorithms for modelling stage. I will diversify my project's pain points based on my interest and keep on improving my modelling techniques to develop a model with high performance and high accuracy. Feel free to browse through my data science projects and happy to hear your feedback.
