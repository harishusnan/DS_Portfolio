## Hello Folks! Welcome to my data science projects repository!


### About Me

A young and inquisitive electrical engineering graduate who is passionate about artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications. **Completed Data Science with Python and R course** by 360DigiTMG and Center of Applied Data Science (CADS) **certified Advanced Enterprise Data Analyst Program**. Approximately 1-year of working experience in **program management area** in structured and unstructured data projects. 

Currently, I am focusing on building my data science portfolio through machine learning model development for my data science projects. I am applying exploratory descriptive analysis (EDA) approach for data preparation and supervised and unsupervised algorithms for modelling stage. I will diversify my project's pain points based on my interest and keep on improving my modelling techniques to develop a model with high performance and high accuracy. Feel free to browse through my data science projects and happy to hear your feedback.

### Project Summary

#### Project 1: 
###### Stock Prices Prediction Model

Develop a supervised machine learning model using Linear Regression (LR) method and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as a technical                     indicator for stock prices prediction

###### Problem Statement

Mr Z is a huge fan of Blizzard company and he has an extra money for an investment. He want to invest in a company with **high reputation** and the **price movement** of its stock prices is **strong uptrend**. It is important for him to analyze the company performance and its stock price pattern before he started to invest his money. Furthermore, identifying the **right time to buy the stock** is his main goal once recognizing the company's stock price pattern.


###### Original Dataset

###### Analysis

We checked our dataset if there are outliers exist and we also wanted to see the price movement pattern.

![Price_movement](https://github.com/harishusnan/Project-1-Stock-Price-Prediction/blob/main/images/Price_Movement.png)

Based on the illustrations above, there are **no outliers exist** in our dataset and the price movement is **strong uptrend**.

Next, we included exponential moving average (EMA) as our technical indicator in developing the prediction model. We decided to calculate the EMA over 10 days period. The output is recorded in the project details (link is provided in the table above). Line chart below showed the comparison between actual price and EMA output after a proper data cleansing.

###### Develop Model

We split 80% of our data into training dataset and 20% of the remaining data into testing dataset.
