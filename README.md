### About Me

Hello Folks! Welcome to my data science projects repo!

Sharing with you about myself in brief.

A young and inquisitive electrical engineering graduate who is passionate about artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications. Completed Data Science with Python and R course by 360DigiTMG and Center of Applied Data Science (CADS) certified Data Analytics Program. Having experience in program management area in structured and unstructured data projects. Currently, I am focusing on building my data science portfolio through machine learning model development for my data science projects. I am applying exploratory descriptive analysis (EDA) approach for data preparation and supervised and unsupervised algorithms for modelling stage. I will diversify my project's pain points based on my interest and keep on improving my modelling techniques to develop a model with high performance and high accuracy. Feel free to browse through my data science projects and happy to hear your feedback.

Progress over perfection! Progress can be made, perfection will never arrive.
